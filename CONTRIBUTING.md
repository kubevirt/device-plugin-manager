# Contributor compliance with Developer Certificate Of Origin (DCO)

We require every contributor to certify that they are legally permitted to contribute to our project.
A contributor expresses this by consciously signing their commits, and by this act expressing that
they comply with the [Developer Certificate Of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)

A signed commit is a commit where the commit message contains the following content:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <jdoe@example.org>
```

This can be done by adding [`--signoff`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---signoff) to your git command line.
